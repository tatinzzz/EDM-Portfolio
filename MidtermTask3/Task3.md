- Job role with the highest average salary
- Company size that pays the highest salary
- Sector with the lowest & highest number of Data Science jobs
- Sector with the minimum & maximum average salary
### Step 3:Create a pivot table
- Use pivot tables to summarize data for sector jobs and salary (d & e)
- Generate charts for reports
- Use bar, column, or pie charts to visualize salary trends and job distribution
### Step 3:Insert slicers for filtering
- Add slicers for role type, company size, and state to make the dashboard interactive
- Add a map (optional)
- If available in your Excel version, insert a map visualization to show job distribution by state
### Step 4: Apply design & formatting
- Customize the colors, fonts, and layout to make the dashboard visually appealing
- Complete the dashboard
- Ensure all required visuals and reports are included
- The slicers should be functional and interactive
